// Lubanso Bitcoin Library

//! Bitcoin transactions.
//!
//! A transaction describes a transfer of money. It consumes previously-unspent
//! transaction outputs and produces new ones, satisfying the condition to spend
//! the old outputs (typically a digital signature with a specific key must be
//! provided) and defining the condition to spend the new ones. The use of digital
//! signatures ensures that coins cannot be spent by unauthorized parties.
//!
//! This module provides the structures and functions needed to support transactions.
